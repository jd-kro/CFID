	<h3>General Questions about CFID  </h3>
	<div>
		<p>
		Overview questions about CFID, who to contact, updates, etcc.
		</p>

        <ul>
        <li><b>Question 1: What is CFID?</b> <br /> <br />
            Answer:  The Comprehensive Freight Improvement Database (CFID) is a multifaceted database containing a rich array of attribute and spatial information 
            about issues affecting goods movement in the Greater Tampa Bay Region. CFID is a web mapping application that was developed by the Florida Department of 
            Transportation (FDOT) to create and maintain a running spatial inventory of roadway and 
            other transportation infrastructure issues and needs that impact regional goods movement and local accessibility to freight activity locations.

            <br />
            <br />
        </li> 
	    <li><b>Question 2: Who operates and maintains the website?</b> <br /> <br />
            Answer: The Tampa Bay Goods Movement Team operates and maintains the website.

            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
		 <li><b>Question 3: Who is responsible for the maintenance an updates to CFID?</b> <br /> <br />
           Answer: The stakeholders including public transportation agencies, consultants, and freight and trucking firms.

            <br />
            <br />
        </li>   

       <li><b>Question 4: Who should I contact for additional information regarding CFID?</b> <br /> <br />
          Answer: Please contact us here: <a href="http://tampabayfreight.com/contact-us/">http://tampabayfreight.com/contact-us/</a>
            <br />
            <br />
        </li> 
        <li><b>Question 5: Where does the data come from?</b> <br /> <br />
         Answer: The data in CFID originates from the provisional data phase provided by our stakeholders and experts who know and enter specific issues 
                 into CFID that are located on the freight network. The original CFID data originated from Freight Hotspots and by utilizing the District 7 
                 (Citrus, Hernando, Pasco, Hillsborough, Pinellas counties) and District 1 (Manatee, Polk, Sarasota counties) Freight Corridor Reports, which 
                 analyzed state roadway conditions and issues. Consequently, items that were shown to be affecting and problematic 
                 for freight movement were standardized and entered into a database for further analysis and reporting.
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
             <li><b>Question 6: How are the projects prioritized?</b> <br /> <br />
    Answer: Prioritization is assessed by the relative importance of the issue. High Priority issues are on roadways that have known and obvious operational, 
                 capacity, maintenance, and/or safety issues. Prioritization is primarily based on relatively high level of truck traffic and congestion among 
                 other factors. Proximity, secondary roadways should be considered when assigning priority. Low Priority issues may be based on low truck volume 
                 roadways and proximity to freight activity centers and the operational conditions may not impede moderate to excessive amounts of freight movement.
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
              <li><b>Question 7: How is the Implementation Ease assigned to a project?</b> <br /> <br />
   Answer: Implementation Ease assigns the relative effort to implement the assessed improvement. Assigning the Implementation Ease requires reviewing the freight 
                  need and constraints. The greater the physical constraints the more difficult the Implementation Ease.  
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>

            <li><b>Question 8: How long does it usually take to implement an improvement?</b> <br /> <br />
   Answer: The time it takes to implement an improvement can vary greatly as many variables are considered. Some improvements can be resolved in a short amount of time, similar to Signal Timings or Landscaping/Sight Distance. Longer term or more 
                constrained improvements can take much longer or possibly years to resolve through larger scale projects and assigned funding through work program.  
            <br />

	<h3>Web Application Specific Tasks and Questions</h3>
	<div>
        <p>
            Covers how to accomplish frequently performed tasks while using CFID.
	
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Question 18: How do I query the data and how do the filters work?</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                Answer:  Expand and collapse filters by clicking on the filter heading.  CFID utilizes
                an intuitive menu of expandable filters to enable users to quickly locate 
                freight improvement issues by location, type, priority, ease of implementation,
                and a host of other variables.  
                Multiple selections can be made within and across filters to retrieve CFID records
                matching any given set of criteria. 
                Expanding the filter will display the categorical values associated with the heading,
                while collapsing a heading simplifies the display by hiding its 
                underlying values.  This enhances the overall legibility of the user interface and
                allows users to quickly locate the filter headings that most interest them.  
                For any given heading, each value may be checked on or off to limit the results
                that will be returned by the filter tool to those that match the selected 
                criteria.  Multiple selections can be made under one or more headings.  
                When selecting desired criteria, the grid view will dynamically update to display
                all matching records.     
            <br />
                <br />
            </li>
            <li><b>Question 19: How do I print a specific detailed record?</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                Answer: Once a record has been identified, on the bottom panel there is a link named
                "More Info". 
                Click on the link, which will open the details in a new browser tab, and is easily
                printable using keyboard "CTRL” + “P”     
            <br />
                <br />
            </li>

            <li><b>Question 20: Why doesn’t the map viewer load in my browser?</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                Answer: It sounds like your browser may be out of date. CFID is compatible with
                most browsers, which includes: Internet Explorer 8.0, 9.0, 10.x, and Chrome 28.0,
                29.0, 30.0, 31.x     
            <br />
